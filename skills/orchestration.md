# dApp Orchestration

## What You Probably Got Wrong

**SE2 has specific patterns you must follow.** Generic "build a dApp" advice won't work. SE2 auto-generates `deployedContracts.ts` — DON'T edit it. Use Scaffold hooks, NOT raw wagmi. External contracts go in `externalContracts.ts` BEFORE building the frontend.

**There are three phases. Never skip or combine them.** Contracts -> Frontend -> Production. Each has validation gates.

## The Three-Phase Build System

| Phase | Environment | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Local fork | Contracts + UI on localhost. Iterate fast. |
| **Phase 2** | Live network + local UI | Deploy contracts to mainnet/L2. Test with real state. Polish UI. |
| **Phase 3** | Production | Deploy frontend to IPFS/Vercel. Final QA. |

## Phase 1: Scaffold (Local)

### 1.1 Contracts

```bash
npx create-eth@latest my-dapp
cd my-dapp && yarn install
yarn fork --network base  # Terminal 1: fork of real chain (or mainnet, your target chain)
yarn deploy               # Terminal 2: deploy contracts
```

> **Always fork, never `yarn chain`.** `yarn fork` does everything `yarn chain` does AND gives you real protocol state — Uniswap, USDC, Aave, whale balances, everything already deployed. `yarn chain` gives you an empty chain that tempts you into writing mock contracts you don't need. Don't mock what already exists onchain — just fork it.

**Critical steps:**
1. Write contracts in `packages/foundry/contracts/` (or `packages/hardhat/contracts/`)
2. Write deploy script
3. Add ALL external contracts to `packages/nextjs/contracts/externalContracts.ts` — BEFORE Phase 1.2
4. Write tests (>=90% coverage)
5. Security audit before moving to frontend

**Validate:** `yarn deploy` succeeds. `deployedContracts.ts` auto-generated. Tests pass.

### 1.2 Frontend

```bash
yarn fork --network base  # Terminal 1: fork of real chain (has Uniswap, USDC, etc.)
yarn deploy --watch       # Terminal 2: auto-redeploy on changes
yarn start                # Terminal 3: Next.js at localhost:3000
```

**USE SCAFFOLD HOOKS, NOT RAW WAGMI:**

```typescript
// Read
const { data } = useScaffoldReadContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "balanceOf",
  args: [address],
  watch: true,
});

// Write
const { writeContractAsync, isMining } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");
await writeContractAsync({
  functionName: "swap",
  args: [tokenIn, tokenOut, amount],
  onBlockConfirmation: (receipt) => console.log("Done!", receipt),
});

// Events
const { data: events } = useScaffoldEventHistory({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "SwapExecuted",
  fromBlock: 0n,
  watch: true,
});
```

### The Three-Button Flow (MANDATORY)

Any token interaction shows ONE button at a time:
1. **Switch Network** (if wrong chain)
2. **Approve Token** (if allowance insufficient)
3. **Execute Action** (only after 1 & 2 satisfied)

Never show Approve and Execute simultaneously.

### UX Rules

- **Human-readable amounts:** `formatEther()` / `formatUnits()` for display, `parseEther()` / `parseUnits()` for contracts
- **Loading states everywhere:** `isLoading`, `isMining` on all async operations
- **Disable buttons during pending txs** (blockchains take 5-12s)
- **Never use infinite approvals** — approve exact amount or 3-5x
- **Helpful errors:** Parse "insufficient funds," "user rejected," "execution reverted" into plain language

**Validate:** Full user journey works with real wallet on localhost. All edge cases handled.

## NEVER COMMIT SECRETS TO GIT

**Before touching Phase 2, read this.** AI agents are the #1 source of leaked credentials on GitHub. Bots scrape repos in real-time and exploit leaked secrets within seconds.

**This means ALL secrets — not just wallet private keys:**
- **Wallet private keys** — funds drained in seconds
- **API keys** — Alchemy, Infura, Etherscan, WalletConnect project IDs
- **RPC URLs with embedded keys** — e.g. `https://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`
- **OAuth tokens, passwords, bearer tokens**

**Before every `git add` or `git commit`:**
```bash
# Check for leaked secrets
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -iE '\.env|key|secret|private'
grep -rn "0x[a-fA-F0-9]\{64\}" packages/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.sol"
grep -rn "g.alchemy.com/v2/[A-Za-z0-9]" packages/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
grep -rn "infura.io/v3/[A-Za-z0-9]" packages/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```

**Your `.gitignore` MUST include:**
```
.env
.env.*
*.key
broadcast/
cache/
node_modules/
```

## Phase 2: Live Contracts + Local UI

1. Update target networks config to your L2/mainnet
2. Fund deployer wallet, send real ETH
3. Deploy contracts to live network
4. Verify contracts on block explorer
5. Test with real wallet, small amounts ($1-10)
6. Polish UI — remove template branding, custom styling

**Design rule:** NO LLM SLOP. No generic purple gradients. Make it unique.

**Validate:** Contracts verified on block explorer. Full journey works with real contracts.

## Phase 3: Production Deploy

### Pre-deploy Checklist
- Update metadata (title, description, OG image 1200x630px)
- Restore any test values to production values

### Production QA
- [ ] App loads on public URL
- [ ] Wallet connects, network switching works
- [ ] Read + write contract operations work
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] OG image works in link previews
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Tested with MetaMask, Rainbow, WalletConnect

## Phase Transition Rules

**Phase 3 bug -> go back to Phase 2** (fix with local UI + prod contracts)
**Phase 2 contract bug -> go back to Phase 1** (fix locally, write regression test, redeploy)
**Never hack around bugs in production.**

## AI Agent Commerce: End-to-End Flow (ERC-8004 + x402)

### The Full Cycle

```
1. DISCOVER  Agent queries ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry
             -> finds agents with matching service tag

2. TRUST     Agent checks ReputationRegistry
             -> filters by uptime >99%, quality >85

3. CALL      Agent sends HTTP GET to endpoint
             -> receives 402 Payment Required

4. PAY       Agent signs EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization
             -> payment settled on Base (~$0.001 gas)

5. RECEIVE   Server returns 200 OK + data

6. RATE      Agent posts feedback to ReputationRegistry
             -> builds onchain reputation for next caller
```

### Key Contracts
- **ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry:** `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432`
- **ReputationRegistry:** `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63`

### Key Projects
- **ERC-8004** — agent identity + reputation
- **x402** — HTTP payment protocol (Coinbase)
- **A2A** — agent-to-agent communication (Google)
- **MCP** — model context protocol (Anthropic)
